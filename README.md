# Fibonacci Sequence Generator with Limit (C)

This C program generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer limit. It then calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence numbers that are less than or equal to this limit.  The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code in a file named `fibonaccilimitfinal.c` (or any other name with a `.c` extension).

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc fibonaccilimitfinal.c -o fibonaccilimitfinal
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `fibonaccilimitfinal` (or `fibonaccilimitfinal.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./fibonaccilimitfinal  # On Linux/macOS
    fibonaccilimitfinal.exe # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will print the Fibonacci sequence numbers up to the specified limit, separated by commas.
